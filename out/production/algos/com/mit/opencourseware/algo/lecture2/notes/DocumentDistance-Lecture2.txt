Lecture 2 ( Models of Computation )
=====================

Whats an algorithm?
	Computaional procedure for solving a problem
	Mathematical analog of computer code.
	Input -> Algorithm -> Output

Model of computation
1. Specifics
2. What operation an algorithm is allowed
3. cost ( time, .. ) of each op.

1. Random Access Machine ( RAM )
- Random access memory ( modeled by big array )
- in theta(1) time
	- can load O(1)
	- do computation O(1)
	- store O(1)
- O(1) registers

- word : w bits

2. Pointer Machine:
- Dynamically allocated objects
- object has O(1) fields
- fields  = word or pointer


Algorithm
------------------
Document Distance

d( D1, D2 ) closeness between 2 documents
- document = sequence of words
- words = string of alphanumeric chars
- idea = shared words
D[w] = number of occurances of w in document D

D1 = "the cat"
D2 = "the dog"

d'( D1, D2) =  D1.D2
	    = Sigma D1[w].D2[w] / |D1||D2|

d(D1, D2)= arcos --|


ALgorithm
1. Split Doc into words
2. Compute word frequencies
3. Dot product
